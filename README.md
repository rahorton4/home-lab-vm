# Cybersecurity Home Lab

## Overview
This home lab uses Windows and Kali Linux virtual machines to practice cybersecurity techniques in a safe, isolated environment. The lab is designed for hands-on learning of system administration, networking, and basic penetration testing.

## Tools & Technologies
- Virtual Machines: Windows 10, Kali Linux using VirtualBox
- System Administration: Windows and Linux configuration, network setup, and security hardening
- Applications: Configured and installed various applications (detailed in a separate project repository)

## Lab Exercises
- Built and configured VMs with proper networking and security settings.
- Experimented with network monitoring, traffic analysis, and system administration tasks.
- Practiced using PowerShell to run executions for SOC Automation project documented in a seperate repository.
